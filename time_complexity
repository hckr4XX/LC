# Time complexity measures how the runtime grows as N becomes very large.

    We will always calculate the time complexity for the worst-case scenario.
    We will avoid including the constant terms.
    We will also avoid the lower values.



    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            // constant time statement
        }
    }



Step 1: Count how many times the "inner loop" runs

From the image:

i value	j runs	times
0	0	           1
1	0,1	           2
2	0,1,2	       3
3	0,1,2,3	       4
…	…	…
N−1	0 to N−1	   N

So total executions of the inner block:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + N


## that is O(N^2)
